# Tools for working with ARD/ARH files

This repository hosts some tools to work with .ard/.arh files from the Switch Xenoblade games.

* [ardain](ardain), a library to inspect the structure of an ARH/ARD file system.
* [fuse-ard](fuse-ard), a [FUSE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html) 
driver to work with ARD archives as regular mounts, inspired
by AVFS and the like.

More tools may be added in the future.
